## Theory and Foundations

#### Transition Matrix
What role does the transition matrix play in Markov Chain modeling, and how would you interpret its values in the context of multi-channel attribution?

#### Absorbing States
Why is it important to have an absorbing state (e.g., "Conversion" or "Drop-off") in a Markov Chain for multi-channel attribution, and how does its absence affect the model?

#### Stationary Distribution
How would you interpret the stationary distribution in a multi-channel attribution model? Is it relevant to your analysis?

#### Memorylessness Property
How does the Markov property (memorylessness) align with the customer journey in multi-channel attribution? What are the limitations of assuming memorylessness in real-world customer behavior?

#### Order of the Chain
When might it be necessary to use a higher-order Markov Chain in multi-channel attribution, and how would you model it?

## Practical Application

#### Data Preparation
What preprocessing steps are essential before applying a Markov Chain model to customer journey data?

#### Missing Data
How would you handle missing or incomplete customer journeys in your dataset when building the transition matrix?

#### Channel Grouping
What criteria would you use to decide whether to combine or separate certain channels in the transition matrix?

#### Path Probabilities
Describe how you would calculate the probability of a customer converting after following a specific sequence of channels.

#### Model Evaluation
What metrics would you use to evaluate the effectiveness of your Markov Chain model in attributing conversions accurately?

## Advanced Analysis

#### Attribution Insights
Explain how you would derive the removal effect for each channel using the Markov Chain model.

#### Channel Interactions
How can you use the transition matrix to analyze interactions between channels (e.g., synergy effects)?

#### Time-Dependent Transitions
How would you modify the Markov Chain to account for time-varying transition probabilities? What challenges might arise?

#### Model Assumptions
What are the key assumptions of a Markov Chain model in multi-channel attribution, and how would you test if your data meets these assumptions?

#### Alternative Methods
Under what circumstances might you choose a non-Markovian model for multi-channel attribution, and why?
